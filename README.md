# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Binary Search Tree
- typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;

## AVL Tree
- typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;

## Max Binary Heap
- typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
